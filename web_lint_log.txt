Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 8.57.1

ESLint couldn't find the plugin "eslint-plugin-react".

(The package "eslint-plugin-react" was not found when loaded as a Node module from the directory "C:\Users\HP\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\justback-platform\admin-dashboard".)

It's likely that the plugin isn't installed correctly. Try reinstalling by running the following:

    npm install eslint-plugin-react@latest --save-dev

The plugin "eslint-plugin-react" was referenced from the config file in ".eslintrc.json".

If you still can't figure out the problem, please stop by https://eslint.org/chat/help to chat with the team.
