Warning: Flutter support for your project's Android Gradle Plugin version (Android Gradle Plugin version 8.2.1) will soon be dropped. Please upgrade your Android Gradle Plugin version to a version of at least Android Gradle Plugin version 8.3.0 soon.
Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your project's AGP version is typically defined in the plugins block of the `settings.gradle` file (C:\Users\HP\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\justback-platform\mobile\android/settings.gradle), by a plugin with the id of com.android.application. 
If you don't see a plugins block, your project was likely created with an older template version. In this case it is most likely defined in the top-level build.gradle file (C:\Users\HP\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\justback-platform\mobile\android/build.gradle) by the following line in the dependencies block of the buildscript: "classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:<version>'".


FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred configuring project ':flutter_paystack'.
> Could not create an instance of type com.android.build.api.variant.impl.LibraryVariantBuilderImpl.
   > Namespace not specified. Specify a namespace in the module's build file. See https://d.android.com/r/tools/upgrade-assistant/set-namespace for information about setting the namespace.

     If you've specified the package attribute in the source AndroidManifest.xml, you can use the AGP Upgrade Assistant to migrate to the namespace value in the build file. Refer to https://d.android.com/r/tools/upgrade-assistant/agp-upgrade-assistant for general information about using the AGP Upgrade Assistant.
