Warning: Flutter 
support for your 
project's Android 
Gradle Plugin version 
(Android Gradle 
Plugin version 8.2.1) 
will soon be dropped. 
Please upgrade your 
Android Gradle Plugin 
version to a version 
of at least Android 
Gradle Plugin version 
8.3.0 soon.
Alternatively, use 
the flag "--android-sk
ip-build-dependency-va
lidation" to bypass 
this check.

Potential fix: Your 
project's AGP version 
is typically defined 
in the plugins block 
of the 
`settings.gradle` 
file (C:\Users\HP\.gem
ini\antigravity\scratc
h\justback-platform\mo
bile\android/settings.
gradle), by a plugin 
with the id of com.and
roid.application. 
If you don't see a 
plugins block, your 
project was likely 
created with an older 
template version. In 
this case it is most 
likely defined in the 
top-level 
build.gradle file (C:\
Users\HP\.gemini\antig
ravity\scratch\justbac
k-platform\mobile\andr
oid/build.gradle) by 
the following line in 
the dependencies 
block of the 
buildscript: 
"classpath 'com.androi
d.tools.build:gradle:<
version>'".

Warning: SDK 
processing. This 
version only 
understands SDK XML 
versions up to 3 but 
an SDK XML file of 
version 4 was 
encountered. This can 
happen if you use 
versions of Android 
Studio and the 
command-line tools 
that were released at 
different times.
