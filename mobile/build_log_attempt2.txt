this check.

Potential fix: Your 
project's AGP version is 
typically defined in the 
plugins block of the 
`settings.gradle` file (C:\Us
ers\HP\.gemini\antigravity\sc
ratch\justback-platform\mobil
e\android/settings.gradle), 
by a plugin with the id of 
com.android.application. 
If you don't see a plugins 
block, your project was 
likely created with an older 
template version. In this 
case it is most likely 
defined in the top-level 
build.gradle file (C:\Users\H
P\.gemini\antigravity\scratch
\justback-platform\mobile\and
roid/build.gradle) by the 
following line in the 
dependencies block of the 
buildscript: "classpath 'com.
android.tools.build:gradle:<v
ersion>'".
