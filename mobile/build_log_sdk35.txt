support for your project's 
Android Gradle Plugin 
version (Android Gradle 
Plugin version 8.2.1) will 
soon be dropped. Please 
upgrade your Android Gradle 
Plugin version to a version 
of at least Android Gradle 
Plugin version 8.3.0 soon.

Alternatively, use the flag "

cy-validation" to bypass 
this check.

Potential fix: Your 
project's AGP version is 
typically defined in the 
plugins block of the 
`settings.gradle` file (C:\Us
ers\HP\.gemini\antigravity\sc
ratch\justback-platform\mobil
e\android/settings.gradle), 
by a plugin with the id of 
com.android.application. 
If you don't see a plugins 
block, your project was 
likely created with an older 
template version. In this 
case it is most likely 
defined in the top-level 
build.gradle file (C:\Users\H
P\.gemini\antigravity\scratch
\justback-platform\mobile\and
roid/build.gradle) by the 
following line in the 
dependencies block of the 
buildscript: "classpath 'com.
android.tools.build:gradle:<v
ersion>'".

Font asset "MaterialIcons-Regular.otf" was tree-shaken, reducing it from 1645184 to 21096 bytes (98.7% reduction). Tree-shaking can be disabled by providing the --no-tree-shake-icons flag when building your app.
