Warning: Flutter support for 
your project's Android 
Gradle Plugin version 
(Android Gradle Plugin 
version 8.2.1) will soon be 
dropped. Please upgrade your 
Android Gradle Plugin 
version to a version of at 
least Android Gradle Plugin 
version 8.3.0 soon.
Alternatively, use the flag "
--android-skip-build-dependen
cy-validation" to bypass 
this check.

Potential fix: Your 
project's AGP version is 
typically defined in the 
plugins block of the 
`settings.gradle` file (C:\Us
ers\HP\.gemini\antigravity\sc
ratch\justback-platform\mobil
e\android/settings.gradle), 
by a plugin with the id of 
com.android.application. 
If you don't see a plugins 
block, your project was 
likely created with an older 
template version. In this 
case it is most likely 
defined in the top-level 
build.gradle file (C:\Users\H
P\.gemini\antigravity\scratch
\justback-platform\mobile\and
roid/build.gradle) by the 
following line in the 
dependencies block of the 
buildscript: "classpath 'com.
android.tools.build:gradle:<v
ersion>'".

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred 
configuring project 
':flutter_paystack'.
> Could not create an 
instance of type com.android.
build.api.variant.impl.Librar
yVariantBuilderImpl.
   > Namespace not 
specified. Specify a 
namespace in the module's 
build file. See https://d.and
roid.com/r/tools/upgrade-assi
stant/set-namespace for 
information about setting 
the namespace.

     If you've specified the 
package attribute in the 
source AndroidManifest.xml, 
you can use the AGP Upgrade 
Assistant to migrate to the 
namespace value in the build 
file. Refer to https://d.andr
oid.com/r/tools/upgrade-assis
tant/agp-upgrade-assistant 
for general information 
about using the AGP Upgrade 
Assistant.
